# Til: alle jenter som leser.

Alle hjerters dag, 14\. februar, vekker fram mange følelser. Både gode og dårlige. Jeg skal ikke være han som kritiserer de kjemperomantiske eller rakker ned på de ensomme. 

Istedet skal jeg benytte anledningen til å si: Jeg elsker jenter som leser!

Gjennom facebook snublet jeg over diktet_"I want a girl who reads",_skrevet av Mark Grist. Han er engelsklærer og poet, og han utrykker dette tusen ganger bedre enn meg. 

Og gutter - om noen av dere lurer på om dikt funker på jenter - så kan dere høre på hun som holder kameraet på videoen under, at det funker. 

# I want a girl who reads

By Mark Grist 

So I want a girl who reads.

For me
Is a girl a with passion, wit and dreams 

What supercedes 

But what's more important 

And I'm not saying that I don't like those bits 

Some prefer tits 

See, some guys prefer asses 

As she paraphrases the raunchier moments from the works of Jilly Cooper 

So late at night she'd always have me in a stupor 

Cos she loves the classics and the classics are dirty 

But she'll still be sweet and she'll still be flirty 

so she always ends the winner 

Who'll use what she learns to kick my ass in arguments 

The menu over dinner 

A girl who's eyes will analyse 

I want a girl who reads 

Cos she's interesting & unique
& her theories make me go weak at the knees 

And the information she gets from what she reads makes her a total fox 

She'll sit addicted at breakfast, soaking up the back of the conflakes box 

That she hunts out in crooked bookshops for days and days and days 

With unusual poems and plays 

Who feeds her addiction for fiction 

I want a girl who reads 

but I want a girl who doesn't stop there 

and goes cover to cover with each waterstones three for two offer 

Who'll tie back her hair while reading Jane Eyre 

Or even Heat magazine 

Who's heart bleeds at the words of Graham Greene 

I want a girl who reads 

In a range of social situations 

To hold lively conversation 

She gleans from novels and poetry 

Who needs the written word
& uses the added vocabulary 

I want a girl who reads 

but... 

Cos I know you're not alone in this 

I'm not trying to call you a chauvinist 

Yeah. Reads. 

I want a girl who reads 

Well, if you must know 

All eyes are on me 

The air left the room a long time ago 

I don't feel comfortable 

What do you go for in a girl?" 

I prefer ass. 

"He prefers tits 

Downs his glass 

Gestures where his mate sits 

He crows, lifting a lager to his lips 

"So, what do you go for in a girl?" 

Ha en fin valentin :)
