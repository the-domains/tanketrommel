# Til: alle jenter som leser.

Alle hjerters dag, 14\. februar, vekker fram mange følelser. Både gode og dårlige. Jeg skal ikke være han som kritiserer de kjemperomantiske eller rakker ned på de ensomme. 

Istedet skal jeg benytte anledningen til å si: Jeg elsker jenter som leser!

Gjennom facebook snublet jeg over diktet_"I want a girl who reads",_skrevet av Mark Grist. Han er engelsklærer og poet, og han utrykker dette tusen ganger bedre enn meg. 

Og gutter - om noen av dere lurer på om dikt funker på jenter - så kan dere høre på hun som holder kameraet på videoen under, at det funker.
